In the _deployment_ with ZetaPush, you have 2 parts:

* Hosting and scalability of the worker (_custom cloud services_)
* Hosting of the front end

== Worker

When you deploy the worker (_custom cloud services_) of your application, we take care of the hosting of your code. In addition, we manage the scability of your application.

== Front end

For the front end part, we host your application and return you an unique URL to access to your application. We also link your front end logic with the differents services you need (_custom cloud services_ or _cloud services_ provided by ZetaPush).
