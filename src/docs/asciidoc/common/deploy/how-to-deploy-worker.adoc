NOTE: The _Worker_ is the back end of your application. Generally you put your business logic inside it.

If you want to only deploy your worker on the ZetaPush platform, you can launch:

include::{docdir}/common/code/command-to-deploy-worker.adoc[]

In this case you only deploy your back end code, so no URL will be return.
