In this case, you want to use the login/password authentication for your users in your application.
You want to create a form to let your users log in your application.

To do this, you only need to create a login form and call `login()` method on the `DefaultStandardUserWorkflow` _cloud service_.
If the connection works, the account informations are returned. At this time, you can redirect your user inside your application.

NOTE: In `DefaultStandardUserWorkflow`, you can signin the application with the couples _username/password_ or _email/password_.

.Login
====
We assume that we have a login form that call `login()` method (of our _UserManagement_ class) at the submit action.

import { DefaultStandardUserWorkflow, UsernamePasswordCredentials } from '@zetapush/platform';

class UserManagement {
  constructor(private userManagement: DefaultStandardUserWorkflow) { }

  login(credentials: UsernamePasswordCredentials) {
    // "credentials" can takes "username/password" or "email/password" couples
    this.userManagement.login(credentials).then((account) => {
        // Do what you want with the connected account
        // You can redirect your user in your application at this time
    });
  }

WARNING: If the account is not validated, the login will not work
