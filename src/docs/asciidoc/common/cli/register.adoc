= zeta register

There are 2 types of account on the ZetaPush platform : The *activated account* and the *anonymous account*. You can entirely use ZetaPush with one or the other type of account.

NOTE: This command is automatically called when you run the commands `zeta run` or `zeta deploy`. So, an anonymous account is created when you call these commands. (or activated account with `--email`)


== Anonymous account

The anonymous account is temporary. It is useful to test ZetaPush Celtia. This type of account expire 7 days after the creation.
If you want to keep the data of your account after the expiry, you need to activate it.

== Activate account

This type of account is permanent. You can use ZetaPush Celtia whenever you want.
