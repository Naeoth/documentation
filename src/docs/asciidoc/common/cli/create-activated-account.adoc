You can automatically create a new activated account. For this you can launch :

[source,bash,linenums]
----
$ zeta register --email user@gmail.com
----

When you use `--email`, you specify that you want to create a new activated account.

A prompt ask you to create a password for your account. Then an email is sent to confirm your account. You have 7 days for it.

TIP: If you have an anonymous account in the `.zetarc`, the CLI ask you if you want to move your applications in the new accounts.

WARNING: If you have an anonymous account in the `.zetarc` and you want to keep your data with the new account, you **need** to activate your account before the validity of anonymous account expires.
