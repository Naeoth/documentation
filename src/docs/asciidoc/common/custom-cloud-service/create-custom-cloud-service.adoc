= Syntax of a Custom Cloud Service

First, a _custom cloud service_ is a `class` and its `methods` are the  _cloud functions_. So the most basic example of _custom cloud service_ is below :

include::{docdir}/common/code/basic-custom-cloud-service.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

In your _custom cloud service_ you can also use the existing _cloud services_ provided by ZetaPush :

include::{docdir}/common/code/basic-custom-cloud-service-with-cloud-service.adoc[leveloffset=+1]


= Dependencies

If you use existing _cloud services_ provided by ZetaPush, you need to import them from `@zetapush/platform`. So you need to install this dependency with :

```console
$ npm install --save @zetapush/platform
```

= Use custom cloud service inside another

Like using existing _cloud services_, you can use other _custom cloud services_ into one of them. For that, you proceed like _cloud service_ :

include::{docdir}/common/code/basic-custom-cloud-service-with-custom-cloud-service.adoc[leveloffset=+1]
