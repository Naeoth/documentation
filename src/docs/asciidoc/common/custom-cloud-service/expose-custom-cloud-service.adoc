When you create a _custom cloud service_ you need to register it. Then, if you want to use it on the client side, you need to expose it.

= Example

It is considered that we have 3 _custom cloud services_ :

* Services exposed for the client side
    ** _MyCustomCloudService1_
    ** _MyCustomCloudService2_
* Private service not exposed to the client (pur business logic)
    ** _MyPrivateCustomCloudService_

NOTE: You need to register _custom cloud services_ in the file indicated by the property *main* in the `package.json`
