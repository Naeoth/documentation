When you create a _custom cloud service_ that you want to expose to the client, you need to declare it. You have 2 cases :

* Only one _custom cloud service_ exposed
* Many _custom cloud servcies_ exposed 

NOTE: The `package.json` has a property named `main`. It defines the file where the _custom cloud services_ are exposed. The following examples define them in `worker/index.js`.

= Only one custom cloud service exposed

In this example, we have 2 _custom cloud services_ : One is private and the second is exposed :

include::{docdir}/common/code/expose-one-custom-cloud-service.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

= Many custom cloud services exposed

In this example, we want to expose 2 _custom cloud services_. In this case, we need to specify the namespace of each _custom cloud service_ :

include::{docdir}/common/code/expose-many-custom-cloud-services.adoc[leveloffset=+1]
