To specify which account (on the ZetaPush platform) you use for an application, you type the account informations in the `.zetarc`.

The format of this file is the **JSON**. The possible properties are below :

- _developerLogin_ : Login of the developer account on the ZetaPush platform
- _developerPassword_ : Password of the developer account on the ZetaPush platform


include::{docdir}/common/code/minimal-zetarc.adoc[]

TIP: If you don't have any account, you can leave the file empty. When you will deploy or run locally your application, ZetaPush will create an anonymous account for you.
