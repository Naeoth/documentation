== Path of the code

TIP: By convention, ZetaPush Celtia considers that your front code is in the directory `front` and your back code (worker) in `worker`. You can change it by setting path in the `package.json`.

Here is an example of application where the front code is in the directory `front/dist` and the back code in `server` :
