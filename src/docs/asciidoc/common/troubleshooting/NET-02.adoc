== Have you access to the Internet ?

Execute the following command in your terminal:
`$ ping google.com`
And then press Ctrl+C

You should have something like that for a working Internet address:
```
PING google.com (64.233.167.100) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from wl-in-f100.1e100.net (64.233.167.100): icmp_seq=1 ttl=63 time=14.5 ms

64 bytes from wl-in-f100.1e100.net (64.233.167.100): icmp_seq=3 ttl=63 time=17.3 ms

=== Google is unknown or unreachable


If you have this result instead:
`ping: unknown host google.com`
Or this result:
`Destination Host Unreachable`
