If you using npm with a version lower than 6, you can upgrade your npm version with :

.Upgrade npm
[source, console, linenums]
----
$ npm install -g npm@latest
----

Or use _npx_ to launch the script :

.Launch with npx
[source, console, linenums]
----
$ npx npm@latest init @zetapush myApp
----

This will have the same result that using the classic command.
