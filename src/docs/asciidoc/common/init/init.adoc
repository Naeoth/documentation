=== Manual initialization

To start a new application with ZetaPush Celtia, the easiest path is to use the _CLI_. But you can also start your application creating each file you need.

WARNING: Above all, you need to have a ZetaPush account with an existing application. So you can create this with the _console_ (Work in progress) or use the _CLI_ with `npm init @zetapush myApp`.
