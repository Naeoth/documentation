If you have an existing account and you want to create a new application you can use the CLI.

The process is the following:

include::{docdir}/common/diagrams/workflow-init-with-account-without-app.adoc[]

For example you can launch:

[source, console, linenums]
----
$ npm init @zetapush myApp
    --developer-login user@gmail.com
    --developer-password password
----

This is when you launch `zeta run` or `zeta push` that the CLI checks if an application name exists in the `.zetarc`. If there is no _appName_, the CLI executes or deploys the code on a new application.
