Your application is working but only locally. To deploy your application you just need to launch `zeta push`. In this application you already have a npm script so you can run :

.Deploy the application
[source, console]
----
$ npm run deploy
----

This command deploys all in once (Front and Worker). It will return you an unique URL to access to your application.

Enjoy ! Your Avengers Chat is working and deployed !
