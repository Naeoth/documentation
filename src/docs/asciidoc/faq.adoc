Do I have to develop _custom cloud services_ ?::
  No. Developing _custom cloud services_ is not required. You can use _cloud services_ that are already provided by ZetaPush. You may need to develop _custom cloud services_ in different situations:
  - You have several devices so you want to mutualize your business code
  - ZetaPush services are not fully compatible with your business needs
